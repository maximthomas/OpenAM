/**
 * Brings the realm's OAuth2 provider up to what every spec here needs -- creating it first if absent --

 *
 *   1. `openid` / `uma_protection` / `uma_authorization` are issuable (only ever ADDS scopes).
 *   2. `coreOAuth2Config.savedConsentAttribute` is non-empty, which keeps the consent page rendering
 *      `isSaveConsentEnabled: true` -- the 5-E2 row-2 oracle.
 *
 * They are checked separately on purpose: coupling (2) to (1) would mean a container that has the scopes but
 * lost the attribute could never be healed, and row 2 would then fail on every future run.
 *
 * ⚠ The realm-config endpoint answers `501 Patch not supported`, so a full-object PUT is the ONLY way to
 * change one field -- and that round trip is lossy in a way that is easy to miss. An UNTOUCHED provider
 * reads back `savedConsentAttribute: ""` and still renders `isSaveConsentEnabled: true` (verified against a
 * freshly created provider on a restarted container). But PUTting that same `""` back stores it as *absent*
 * at the SMS level, and `RealmOAuth2ProviderSettings.isSaveConsentEnabled()` is a plain `!= null` check --
 * so an innocent-looking read-modify-write silently turns the consent page's "save consent" control off,
 * even though nothing appeared to change. Hence invariant 2: never PUT this field as null/empty.
 *
 * Safe from four spec files in parallel: identical writers computing the same target state from the same
 * base, and a loser re-reads rather than failing.
